due to different assumptions on daily maintenance energy

are in accordance with NRC recommendations (NRC 2006j)

The NRC adult maintenance recommendations for dogs assuming a daily energy requirement of 100 kcal/kg BW[0.67]/d
are based on an average maintenance energy requirement (e.g. 253 kcal/d for 4 kg cat). For indoor and/or neutered

living in combination with neutering becomes increasingly

FEDIAF however takes a different approach and uses applicable for adult pet cats in Europe. This is acknowledged
